Wellcome to Python Tkinter Calculator!

  * windows users: run __main__.pyw to start the calculator without console.
  * unix-like users: run either __main__.py (e.g. "python __main__.py") or as a directory (e.g. "python .").
  * 'calc.history' is an example file you can load to check if all is working fine.
